# 0010_CountSetOfCharacters

# Sample Exercise

### Write a program which reads a set of numbers, until the EOF, from the standard input (stdin) using getchar() function and prints the number of  letters in the input and the consonants in capital letters.

**_input: <set of characters>_**
**_output: <# of letters read><space character><string of consonants in capital leters>_**

*For example:*
--

**_for the following input:_**

>Sample Input: a b     kL m   45 â€™!   u a   m    P

**_There are 9 characters in the input stream {a, b ,k, L, m, u, a, m, p}. 9 is your first output. Your second out will be the string of consonants in capital letters, shown below:_**

>Sample Output: 9 BKLMMP

**_Please, PAY ATTENTION TO THE I/O FORMAT._**

**_Hint: There can be many white space characters in the input, such as blank, \n, \t etc. You should consider such cases while you are testing your output._**
